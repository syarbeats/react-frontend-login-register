# Simple React Project with Springboot Basic Authentication

This project implemented protected route for path "/user/list", so user must be login first before he can access path "/user/list".
At the moment (July 16, 2019), the project still doesn't use redux for state management. I am going to plan to implement redux for state management in the next iteration.

## Stacks:
1. React
2. Axios
3. React-Router-Dom
